# Handball Connect PRD Summary

This document summarizes the main sections and goals from the provided "Handball Connect" product requirements document. The PRD proposes a digital platform to streamline talent promotion within professional handball.

## Key Points
- **Current Problems**: Handball agents rely on ad-hoc tools like email and Dropbox to share player information. These methods lack organization, metadata, analytics, and professional presentation. Clubs struggle to evaluate players efficiently, and players can miss opportunities.
- **Vision**: Build a dedicated, modern platform for agents and clubs, focusing on user-friendly player profiles, video hosting, search tools, communication, and compliance with data regulations.
- **MVP Features**:
  - Player profile management with CV uploads.
  - Video hosting and basic editing with view analytics.
  - Secure sharing of profiles and reels.
  - Basic player search for clubs.
  - In-platform messaging.
  - Standardized performance data fields and dashboards.
  - GDPR-compliant data handling.
- **Business Model**: Tiered SaaS subscriptions with a freemium entry for agents and paid tiers for professional agents, agencies, and clubs. Potential additional revenue from premium features or partnerships.
- **Roadmap Considerations**: Future AI-assisted video tagging, deeper analytics, mobile apps, and partnerships with governing bodies (e.g., EHAA, EHF).
