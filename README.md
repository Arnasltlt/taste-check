# Handball Connect Prototype

This repository contains a small demo of a potential user interface for the Handball Connect platform.

## Viewing the Demo

Open `frontend/index.html` in a modern web browser to explore the sample UI. The page demonstrates a minimal search experience with a light/dark mode toggle.

The styling is intentionally vibrant and includes basic animations for a smoother user experience. It is not a production-ready design but illustrates how the app could look.
